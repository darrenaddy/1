###### Description

Our engineering department took a fresh look at the tool dolly and knew that Triad could do it better.

The result is the fastest and most labor-saving tool dolly ever! No more lifting the dolly into the firing position. That's now handled by pushbutton actuated air cylinders. A pushbutton also fires the nail gun.

We guarantee you are going to like what you see with the totally redesigned Triad Speed Dolly - our fastest, most versatile, and easiest to use tool dolly EVER.
