###### Description

A Triad MultiBridge gives you TWO gantries with your choice of combined functionalities. *So many* great options! And the MultiBridge can be made to fit most Triad Framing Tables and/or Squaring-Sheathing Tables. 

For example:
A wood-timber builder might choose a Trident Bridge on one gantry, and a Router Bridge on the second gantry. That means the ability to nail the sheathing onto the studs, with three high-capacity nail guns & then (on the return trip) route out the window/door openings with the Router Bridge side. Automatic PlateFire guns are also available, adding a THIRD functionality to the MultiBridge. (PlateFire automatically nails the plates at your choice of nail spacing).

Other options: 
We have had builders purchase a nailing bridge on one gantry, and a panel stapler bridge for the second gantry - offering them versatility in fastener choices or sheathing material choices.
