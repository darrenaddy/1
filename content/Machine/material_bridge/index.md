###### Description

The Triad Material Bridge is designed to move
along the table and hold material for the wall
panels. This allows the operator to place the
material "on the fly" and eliminates extra
walking.

The bridge is guided by a track, squared to the
table. Adding the Material Bridge to any wall
panel table saves labor for faster production times.
