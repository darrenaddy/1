###### Description

The Triad Steel Stud Framing Table is designed for ease in operation
and minimal set-up time to drastically increase
production capabilities of complete steel stud
wall panels.

The Steel Stud Framer can be used for squaring,
framing, and sheathing operations.
Materials can be laid-up quickly using our
color-coded stud locator flippers. The studs can
then be fastened quickly with the rolling Twin
Screw Dollies, which cut production time to just
minutes.

The Triad Twin Screw Dollies employ two electric
industrial screw guns**, which simultaneously
screws both sides of the top and bottom tracks.
Each gun can be separately controlled at each
stud and can drive through materials of differing
gauges. Each gun automatically retracts and the
operator can move the dolly smoothly along the
dolly rail to the next stud location.
