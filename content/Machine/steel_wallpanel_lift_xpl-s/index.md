###### Description

This XPL-S Panel Lift is engineered especially for STEEL STUD wall panels from 4" to a whopping 12" thick & 1000 lbs.

The Triad line of Panel Lifts come ready to bolt together (1 bolt!) and attach to your existing overhead power hoist (or fork lift chain). The constant sizing feature allows the panel lift to be put into place without pushing and pulling by the operator.

The ease of one-person operation increases production with less operator fatigue. When moving empty, the lift holds its size, always ready for the next panel.

###### Features*

- Lift panels from 7' to 14' wide
- For use with overhead crane or forklift overhead lift system.
- Cotter-pinned clevis on both sides to allow fast adjustment for a wide variety of wall panel heights.
- Bronze bushings ensure years of service
