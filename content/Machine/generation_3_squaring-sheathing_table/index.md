###### Description

Triadâ€™s The Generation 3 Squaring/Sheathing Table is available for wall heights up to 16' 3" and wall lengths up to 80'. It allows you to free up your framing table for the next wall panel, while giving you a separate table upon which to sheath (and optionally, router-out openings). 

This table is a perfect match for our [Generation 3 Framing Table](/machine/generation_3_framing_table/). Your wall panel is held securely and squarely during the sheathing and/or routing operations, and large, high-capacity rollers allow you to move the finished wall panel to the next station in your process.

Our Generation 3 design allows for quicker and easier installation, meaning you will be up and running, with increased production, in less time. Like the Generation 3 Framing Table, the Generation 2 Squaring/Sheathing Table offers:

* Wider working surface
* The Generation 3 Tables clamp the wall panels 18% faster
* Clean out of saw dust is easier with new floor panels and slotted traps
* Newly designed floor panels that reduce workers' fatigue & provide a slip-resistant surface.

###### Video Demonstration*

* This video shows the Generation 3 Squaring/Sheathing Table along with a MultiBridge (2 gantry bridge - this one configured with a Trident Sheathing Bridge and a Router Bridge.) This is just *one* bridge option for the Triad Squaring/Sheathing Tables.
