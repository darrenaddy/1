### Description

The Trident Sheathing Bridge is a very popular sheathing bridge choice. Why? 3 high-capacity nailers giv builders flexibility without compromising speed and efficiency, while at the same time significantly reducing tool cost over traditional bridges nailing bridge. Can be operated in your choice of Fully Manual mode, Semi-Automatic mode, or Automated (virtually unmanned) operation.

The Trident Bridge features a programmable touch screen for setting fastener spacing. The Trident Bridge is easily positioned using either a joystick or hand crank. The carriage is lined up with a laser and goes across each stud utilizing all three tools as it does. The bridge can detect openings and does not fire the tools as it glides over the top. The Trident Bridge is more efficient than single tool bar bridges with its unique bidirectional nailing, and always-at-the-ready carriage system. Triad Machines makes a full line of bridges that can be customized to your particular needs.
