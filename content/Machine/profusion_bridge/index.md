###### Description

### The ultimate sheathing bridge, for precision, versatility, automation, and SPEED!

The industry is sitting up and taking notice of the incredible Triad ProFusion Bridge. It is so popular that we are often building sold units two or three at a time. Why? It's FAST and accurate. Six separate high-capacity nailing tools (front side and back side) intelligently divide the work using our exclusive Rational Synergy program. The operator easily lines up the studs using the LIVE Video Assist & joystick controller. 8 servos move the tools and the bridge itself. The bridge is guided by a track, which is squared to the table. Each stud can be nailed in just 2-4 seconds. Auto-nails window openings, top & bottom. Can also be run in Autonomous Mode (no operator at the controls)!

### ProFusion beats "the world's fastest sheathing table".
