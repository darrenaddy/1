###### Description

The superior design and heavy construction of the Triad CN-4 results in truly square clamping results. It provides accurately material placement, presses, and then nails the parts. A stop is provided to limit accidental nailing on the edge. Also, when using nailing tools in the side position, components such as corners, trimmers, partition lead-ins, (and more) can be assembled.
