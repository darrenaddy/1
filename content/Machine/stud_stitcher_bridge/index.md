### Description

Triad's Stud Stitcher Bridge is a one-man framing operation designed for use with the Gen II Framing Table. The operator guides the Stud Stitcher Bridge over a clamped wall and the bridge is ready to fire. The Stud Stitcher clamps the stud horizontally and vertically and places four nails (two on each side of a 2x4 wall) simultaneously fastening both plates and stud. The operator returns the bridge to park with the optional auto-return feature as the wall is moved down the line either with a power chain conveyor or manually.
