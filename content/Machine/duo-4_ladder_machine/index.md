###### Description

The Triad Duo-4 is designed for quick size changes to accommodate either floor trusses or ladders. Clamping is from two directions to ensure tight joints and rigid finished products. The moving bridge completely retracts to accommodate lift-off of the finished product. The studs or ladder rungs are positioned on 16" centers, using stud locators. End squaring stops square up the plates and the hand-operated controls consist of a clamp lever and a nail button. One button fires all four guns simultaneously.
