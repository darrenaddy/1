###### Description

Triad's Template Stair Router (TSR) was designed so an operator can load two 2"x12" stringers, set up the adjustable rise, run and nose clearance quickly, and start routing. The router pair cuts the top or bottom stringer only, OR both stringers simultaneously with the template guided stair profiles. Triad's TSR can accommodate standard profiles, no riser profiles, and split stringer configurations.
