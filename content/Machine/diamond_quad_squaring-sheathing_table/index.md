###### Description

Triad's Diamond Quad Squaring/Sheathing Table was designed to be utilized in a two table wall panel system. The DQ Squaring Table is a means to keep an already framed wall clamped and squared while routing out rough openings with the [Triad Handle Bar Router](/machine/handlebar_router/) or [Triad Router Bridge](/machine/router_bridge/).

Move the table in and out with a drum switch to adjust for different wall heights. Custom sizes are available upon request.

Heavy-Duty rollers are used to roll walls on and off the table. Rollers are 6" OC the first four feet of the table and 12" OC thereafter; making for a smooth transition on and off the squaring table.

Squaring stops exist at the front end of the table and a continuous squaring lip runs the full length of the table on both sides.

The table can be built in lengths from 16' to 80', and is compatible with Triad's [Diamond Quad Framing table](/machine/diamond_quad_framing_table/), [Generation 3 Framing Table, and the](/machine/generation_3_framing_table/), and [Econ-O-Framer](/machine/econo-framer/).
