###### Description

Triad's Easy Framer is our most economical framing table. It combines a table for accurate alignment with the best nailing components available to turn out better quality work faster and for greater profit - in the factory or on the job site! 

All part alignment work is done at the factory. To assemble the table, simply match numbered sections, level and adjust to your desired wall height. Triad's exclusive stud locator flippers make it easy to locate studs and get perfect alignment at common spacing (16" and 24") *without* time-consuming measuring and marking. Adjustable squaring stops for plate placement ensure accurate assembled walls the first time.
