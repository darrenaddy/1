###### Description

Triadâ€™s Generation 3 Framing Table is custom built for 16' to 80' long walls (your choice of maximum length), and offers the greatest wall height range of any Triad Framing Table: With wall heights from 3'9" to 16'3" you can do anything from knee walls to commercial building wall panels. Studs are placed between color-coded stud locators. With just a push of a button, the width adjustment clamp is activated to clamp and square all components at a rate 18% faster than our previous (Gen II) model. The Generation 3 Framer features a wider table top support surface, as well as an innovative, optional, Pop-up Power Chain Conveyor. The Generation 3 was designed with the framer in mind, with our new Slip-Resistant Surface that allows the operator to move about on the machine's interior (when needed) on a comfortable and safe platform.
