###### Description

Take all time-consuming walls off the primary productions line with the Triad
Rake Wall Table. This table produces accurate, quality rake walls and balloon walls that help you focus on your overall lineal footage output to make a more consistent product.

The table has a manually adjustable rake side, 0 to 12/12 pitch.

There are tool dollies, each holds a nailing tool, on the straight side of the table, along with counterbalanced cast iron stud locators that react when studs or components are placed on them.

Stud locators are also located on an adjustable center support bar to help ensure perfectly square walls.
