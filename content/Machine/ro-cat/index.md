###### Description

The Ro-Cat, rough opening component assembly table, takes pre-nailed sub-components and squares the units as an operator joins them to make window and door openings.

By activating the pop-up rollers, the finished window or door buck is pushed off onto a Ro-Cat conveyor, staged for the next wall to be built.

It is easy to use, with no set-up and designed for one man operation. The Ro-Cat has been designed for easy operator access to all nailing positions from 1'6" x 6'9" to 10'0" x 10'0.
