###### Description

The Triad Vertical S-Cat (Sub-Component Assembly Table) works together with the [Triad Ro-Cat](/machine/ro-cat/), enabling the pre-assembly of window and door bucks as needed. This can be done ahead of and in-line with the framing station. The S-Cat allows the operator to pre-fasten cripples to sills and headers. No set-up is required so the Triad Vertical S-Cat is always ready to accept the next sub-component, regardless of what it may be or where it lies in its respective wall.

For both wood and steel framing.
