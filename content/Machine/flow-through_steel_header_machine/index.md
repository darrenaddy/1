###### Description

Triad's Flow-Through Steel Header machine, allows you to build a more consistent quality steel header, in less time - maximizing your available labor. Multiple header sizes are possible.

Assemble your pieces on the mandrel, which provides a square, internal support. Adjust the width of the screw dollies, from 4" up to 16" apart. Feed the mandrel with header into the screw dolly area and engage with a foot switch. Easily glide the piece through on a roller conveyor table, as you drive four screws simultaneously at your desired spacing. The assembled header slides off the mandrel and it is ready to repeat the simple process for the next header.

Your choice of two mandrels is provided with the machine. Additional mandrels are also available, to meet all your header sizing requirements.

The Triad Flow-Through Steel Header Machine is air-driven with easy to understand controls and stop settings. Dump all air in the lines at the touch of a button.
