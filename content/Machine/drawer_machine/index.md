###### Description
Triad's clean, uncomplicated Drawer Machine will speed your production & give you years of trouble-free service. You will find this machine operating in facilities all over North America.

Triad's Drawer Machine comes equipped with two safety switches. Drawer height is also automatically determined by the two sensors. If no material is present, the tools will not activate. Once stapled, the tools will shut off, retract and the machine opens up for removal of finished drawer. 

Push button controls operate the machine.The positive two direction squaring and clamping is controlled by regulated air pressure. Quality castings and machined parts assure you many years of service and minimal down time. The tools cycle in approximately three seconds. Operator controls can be user-selected for either manual or automatic clamp release.
