###### Description

Especially handy for making wise use of limited square footage, the Triad Pop-Up Friction Station will turn any wall panel conveyor into a quick sturdy table (for example for routing out openings after sheathing, with a [Triad Handlebar Router](/machine/handlebar_router/)).  The Pop-Up Friction Station, sits in the middle of any roller conveyor or skate wheel conveyor. When desired, it can pop-up a sheathed wall panel inches above the conveyor. This will allow for routing of the panel, or other necessary operation. When your operation is finished, it releases the panel back down onto the conveyor to move it to the next step in your process.
