###### Description

Easily and economically route your wall panel openings with the (2 person) Triad Handlebar Router! Designed with safety, convenience, *and* long life, the popular Handlebar Router features:

- On and off switch on either end of handlebars
- Low center of gravity for easier handling & maneuverability
- Black phenolic bottom plate reduces surface friction
- 2400 RPM for faster clean cutting.
- Sealed ball bearing construction
- High temp insulation wiring protects motor against burn out
- Oversized fan for maximum cooling and longer motor life
- Center support bar facilitates overhead center balance (for example: an overhead hoist)

NOTE: To accomplish the same work, with just ONE person, consider a [Triad Router Bridge](/machine/router_bridge/) or [Triad MultiBridge](/machine/multibridge/) - with router bridge functionality on one of the two available gantries.
