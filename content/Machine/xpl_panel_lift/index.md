### Description

Triad’s XPL Panel Lift family comes in a variety of sizes and weight capacities. For use with your overhead crane or fork lift.

The XPL-1000 can lift panels from 7' to 12' wall heights and has a weight capacity of 1/2 ton. The constant sizing feature allows the panel lift to be put into place without pushing and pulling by the operator. The ease of one-person operation increases production with less operator fatigue. When moving empty, the lift holds its size, always ready for the next panel.
