### Description

The Triad WorkTable was designed to handle the construction of any non-standard panel or components that would otherwise bog down your production line. It's usage is limited only by your imagination, but some examples include short walls, tall walls, rake walls, or walls that are mostly opening (and very little wall space. It is economical, simple and extremely flexible. One side is fixed and the other side has a range of adjustment, varying the WorkTable's width. The fixed side features a continuous squaring lip & there are nonadjustable squaring stops on the ends of each table. Air activated pop-up rollers allow you to roll off the finished panel (or components).

The WorkTable is similar to the Triad RoCat - with the exception that it is adjustable in width! The minimum table width is 55' and the maximum depends on how far apart you position them. It's range in movement is limited only by how much track you lay on the floor!

It can be made in any length (4' increments) between 12'and 80'.
