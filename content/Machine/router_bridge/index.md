###### Description

Triadâ€™s Router Bridge allows you to router your wall panel openings, such as windows and doors, as an integral part of your process. The dedicated router bridge can be placed over a Triad Framing Table (in a single table workcell system) OR over a Triad Sheathing/Squaring Table (in a two table workflow, which allows your framing table to be working on the next panel, for increased productivity). Short (19 second) video of it operating in the field [here](https://youtube.com/shorts/-l68q0a_dd4?feature=share).
