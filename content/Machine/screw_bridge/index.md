###### Description

Automate and accelerate the  (formerly labor-intensive) sheathing of your wall panels with the precision Triad Screw Bridge. Triad's Screw Bridge handles the precise demands of automated fastening. Every fastening screw can be driven straight, and precisely sunk to fasten the material. 

The Screw Bridge has separate on/off switches for each screw gun, to turn off the guns when they're not in used for rough openings. The push button control automatically activates the air brake, locking the bridge into place for a complete tool cycle. Positive lock will not allow the bridge or tools to stray from position. The hand crank system allows for quick positioning of the bridge and an adjustable rod aligns the bridge with studs and seams to guarantee fast, accurate placement of the screws.
