###### Description

Take all time-consuming walls off the primary productions line with the Steel Rake Wall Framing Table. This table will produce accurate and quality rake walls and balloon walls that allow your main wall line to focus on producing your "bread and butter" - your overall lineal footage output and more consistent product.

The Steel Rake Wall Table has a manually adjustable rake side: 0 to 12/12 pitch. There are twin screw dollies on each side of the table, meaning the both sides of the stud are fixed to the plates simultaneously. Cast iron stud location flippers are counterbalanced and retract when studs or components are placed on them. There are also stud locators on an adjustable center support bar to help ensure perfectly square walls.

Pop-up Skate Wheel Conveyors allow you to easily roll off your assembled panels.
