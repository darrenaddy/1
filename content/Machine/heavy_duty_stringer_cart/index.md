###### Description

Similar to our popular [Plate Cart](/machine/plate_cart/), the Heavy Duty Stringer Cart is used to transport stringer material near the stair saw or router. A second Stringer Cart could be used to hold finished stringers output by the stair saw or router. The design also gives you the option to drop in a plywood insert to have a handy shelves for supplies or other temporary needs.

Easy rolling casters make it easy to spin the cart 180 degrees for material on the other side. Larger casters (higher in the center) allows it to "turn on a dime" and less resistance when rolling across the floor. Save wasted footsteps, with the Triad Heavy Duty Stringer Cart!
